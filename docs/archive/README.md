# Archived Docs

These documents are prior iterations of the Global Vocabulary documentation.

These files are kept for historical context only. They describe older models
(notably: **facet-based tags**) that are **not** the current implementation.

Current spec (source of truth):
- `docs/global-vocabulary.md` (tags are one thing; roles are derived by usage)
- `docs/workspace-vocabulary.md` (workspace draft overlay + promote-to-global)
