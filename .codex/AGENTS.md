# Agent Notes

This repo is driven by design docs. Review these before implementation:
- `docs/product-demand-fulfillment-thesis.v2.md`
- `docs/product-demand-fulfillment-roadmap.md`
- `docs/product-demand-fulfillment-model-audit.md`
- `docs/service-material-assemblies.md`
- `docs/global-vocabulary.md`
- `docs/archive/` (prior iterations)

Process requirements:
- Update `docs/product-demand-fulfillment-roadmap.md` after every meaningful change.
- If model decisions change, update the audit doc and relevant design docs.
- Global attribute library is a separate Mongo DB (`GLOBAL_LIBRARY_DB_NAME`).
